### Why
We are suffering from the maximum amount of private repositories on GitHub, and one major reason is that iOS team has occupied lots of private repositories.
Therefore, we have to rearrange them, and figure out a way to keep current projects working because of dependencies.

### Solution
We manage the dependencies of each project with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), and there are several private Pod components on GitHub.
So, one possible solution is that we integrate all the private Pod components into one big project as well as one private repository.

### Implementation

### Result
